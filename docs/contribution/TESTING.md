# Testing

> For component library to be stable, it must be testable and tested

## Test Types

### Component (Unit) Tests

1. Tests are running with [`jest`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) in and `JSDOM` environment.

1. Tests in this API level are ones that require browser-like environment but can still run without any visual rendering. The nature of these tests is testing the behavior of a component and wiring methods. For example: clicking on a component triggers a callback, changing the input value, etc...

1. Every component will have the test file next to it with the convention of `ComponentName.spec.js`.

1. Every component uses and expose a **driver**, to help interacting with the component. Read more about drivers [here](./TEST_DRIVERS.md). The driver naming convention is `ComponentName.driver.js`

### Example
```js
import React from 'react';
import checkboxDriverFactory from './Checkbox.driver';
import {createDriverFactory} from 'wix-ui-test-utils/driver-factory';

describe('Checkbox', () => {
    const createDriver = createDriverFactory(checkboxDriverFactory);

    it('should be unchecked and not disabled by default', () => {
      const driver = createDriver(<Checkbox/>);
      expect(driver.isChecked()).toBeFalsy();
      expect(driver.isDisabled()).toBeFalsy();
    });
});
```

### Browser (E2E) Tests

#### General

1. We will test components in browser if we need to test actual browser API (calculations, hovering, styling) or visual changes.
1. Tests are running with [`protractor`](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) which runs in actual `chrome` browser.
1. Visual regression tests are done with [`eyes`](https://github.com/wix/eyes.it) (powered by applitools).

#### File Structure

1. Every component will have the test file next to it with the convention of `ComponentName.e2e.js`.
1. Every component uses and expose a **driver**, to help interacting with the component. Read more about drivers [here](./TEST_DRIVERS.md). The driver naming convention is `ComponentName.protractor.driver.js`

#### Visual testing

1. Every test will be wrapped with `eyes.it()` to automatically capture screenshots at the beginning and end of every test.

1. If some complex interaction is needed during test, use `eyes.checkWindow()` to capture a screenshot.

```js
import eyes from 'eyes.it';

eyes.it('should test something with screenshot diff', async () => {
  expect(await assert).toEqual(expectation);
});

eyes.it('should test something with a screenshot on demand', async () => {
  // do some manipulation, for example scroll
  await eyes.checkWindow('after scrolling');
  // do other manipulations
});
```

#### Test pages

1. Tests pages are the actual documentation done in `storybook`.

1. You may run your test on the story's Playground, or on it's examples.

1. Sometimes you don't want to have tedious testing examples in the documentation story, so you may create a Test story by the name `ComponentTestStory.js` and add to to the `Tests` category in the storybook. Use:

```js
import {getTestStoryKind} from '../storyHierarchy';

const kind = getTestStoryKind({category: 'Layout', storyName: 'Cell'});
storiesOf(kind, module)
  .add('1. Test Page #1', () => {

});
```

## Running the tests

### Running all:

1. `npm run build && npm run test`

### Running components/unit tests:

1. single run: `npm run test:unit`

1. watch mode: `npm run test:watch`

1. watch mode + storybook: `npm start` (This runs also storybook)

#### Debugging

1. In watch mode, you can use `jest`'s interactive mode, for example, press `p` in your command line and type the name of the test:

### Running Browser tests only

#### Single Run
`npm run build && npm run test:e2e`

- `npm run test:e2e` serves the storybook from `storybook-static` folder.
- If you made any changes to components or stories, you need to run `npm run build` (or just `npm run storybook:build`) before running `npm run test:e2e`.
- Changing the tests doesn't require building again.

### Storybook with HMR

- open a terminal console
- `npm run storybook` - serve storybook with hot module reload
- open another terminal console
- `npm run test:e2e-only` - run just e2e tests

#### Running a single test (focused test)

- To make a focused test (only it runs) use `fit` instead of `it`
- OR... use `eyes.fit` instead of `eyes.it`.

#### Debugging

1. Use `await browser.sleep(100000)` in your test, for quick browser stop and debugging.
